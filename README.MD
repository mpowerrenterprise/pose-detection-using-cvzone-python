# Pose Detection Using CvZone Python

## Introduction

3D pose estimation is a process of predicting the transformation of an object from a user-defined reference pose, given an image or a 3D scan. It arises in computer vision or robotics where the pose or transformation of an object can be used for alignment of Computer-Aided Design models, identification, grasping, or manipulation of the object.

## What is CVZONE?

CVzone is the main Framework that is used in this prototype, it is a computer vision package that makes us easy to run like face detection, hand tracking, pose estimation, etc., and also image processing and other AI functions.


## Configuration and Setup

Python is the main programming language of this prototype, OpenCV and CVzone are the major Frameworks.


- Installing OpenCV

  ```python
  pip install opencv-python
  ```

- Installing cvzone

    ```python
    pip install cvzone
    ```

- Or, Installing cvzone using GitHub, (If "pip install cvzone" does not work)

    ```python
    pip install git+https://github.com/cvzone/cvzone.git
    ```
